  I am Pranav Malap, since childhood, I have been interested in technology and I
  have completed my Bachelors in Science (Information Technology) from Mumbai
  University. After completing my graduation I completed my 3 months internship

  After thorough research, I found Master’s program in “Web Engineering” at
  “Chemnitz University of Technology” to be an ideal match for my academic and
  professional goals. I like the core modules, as they build solid foundation
  but specialized modules particularly interest me the most - "Current trends in
  Web Engineering" and "Data Science and Data Engineering" because they align
  with my passion for image processing, artificial intelligence, and data-driven
  decision-making. With a background in web development and system design, I am
  excited to expand my knowledge and contribute to the fields of Artificial
  Intelligence and Computer Science.

  After completing my master’s degree, I plan to return to India and contribute
  to the growing IT and AI sectors. With the advanced skills gained in Germany,
  I aim to work in roles involving web engineering, data-driven systems, or
  intelligent applications. While India has a strong IT industry, Germany offers
  advanced exposure to research, innovation, and cutting-edge technologies.
  Studying there will help me gain global experience, which I plan to bring back
  to contribute to the growing tech sector in India.
